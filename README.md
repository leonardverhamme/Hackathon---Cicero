# Cicero: Your AI-Powered Legal Management Platform - Paris AI Hackathon

## üöÄ Project Overview & Vision

Cicero is an innovative, AI-powered Legal Management Platform designed to revolutionize the legal industry from both the client and lawyer perspectives. Our core vision is to create a complete, frictionless platform for legal management, replacing traditional, bulky email communications with intelligent AI agents. This system streamlines the entire legal workflow, from initial client intake to real-time legal assessments and automated communication, providing unprecedented clarity and efficiency.

**The Problem:** The legal landscape is often characterized by inefficient communication, time-consuming compliance processes (especially with complex frameworks like the EU AI Act for HR Tech), and a lack of transparency in billing. Legal professionals spend valuable time on administrative tasks, while clients often struggle to understand legal jargon and track their cases.

**Our Solution (Cicero):** Cicero addresses these challenges by introducing AI agents that act as a bridge between clients and lawyers. Instead of scheduling inefficient calls or sending long emails, lawyers can dispatch AI agents (in the form of Beyond Presence calling agents) to conduct initial intake calls. These calls are transcribed, summarized, and used to query a legal knowledge base (mocked in the demo, with future Weaviate integration). The system then provides real-time, streaming AI-generated legal summaries, detailed EU AI Act assessments, and actionable next steps, all presented within a sleek, intuitive "Legal Mailbox" UI. This allows for rapid triage, identifying cases needing immediate human lawyer intervention versus those that can proceed with standard automated procedures.

Cicero aims to be the first truly convenient legal management system, offering a complete platform where clients have all their legal cases and advice in one place, and lawyers are better prepared with less administrative burden.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### AI Agents & Automated Communication Flow
*   **Frictionless Intake via Beyond Presence Call Agents:** Lawyers can send an AI agent (powered by Beyond Presence) to conduct initial intake calls with clients. This replaces the need for manual email exchanges or scheduling calls for basic information gathering.
*   **Intelligent Inbox:** The platform's inbox is not just for emails; it can be populated with audio and video agents from Beyond Presence, offering a dynamic and interactive communication experience.
*   **Automated Call Processing:**
    1.  **Online Call:** The Beyond Presence agent conducts an online call with the client.
    2.  **Transcription:** The call is automatically transcribed.
    3.  **Summarization:** The transcript is summarized by an OpenAI agent.
    4.  **Knowledge Base Query:** The transcribed content is used to query a vector database (mocked in the demo, future integration with Weaviate) containing legal laws and precedents, connecting the client's case with relevant legal bases.
*   **Benefits:** This process significantly reduces preparation work for lawyers and provides clients with clear, non-legal language summaries, fostering better understanding and communication.

### Legal Assessment & Summaries (Powered by OpenAI Agents)
Cicero employs three streaming AI agents to provide comprehensive legal analysis:
1.  **Summary Agent:** Provides a concise, executive-level summary of the client's AI feature or legal query.
2.  **Legal Assessment Agent:** Generates a structured analysis against specific EU AI Act articles relevant to HR Tech (e.g., Data Governance, Human Oversight, Transparency, High-Risk Classification). This assessment is presented in full legal language for the lawyer.
3.  **Legal Summary & Next Steps Agent:** Offers a high-level legal summary in non-legal language for the client, determines if human legal advice is needed, and assesses the case complexity for internal office assignment (e.g., "Standard HR Tech Compliance" vs. "Complex AI Ethics & Governance"). It also outlines clear next tasks for the client, which are then communicated to the lawyer to maintain an automated workflow.

### Case Management (`My Cases`)
*   **Case Overview:** Provides an easy-to-understand overview of all legal assessments and ongoing cases.
*   **Centralized Legal Hub:** Clients have a single platform to manage all their legal cases and receive advice.
*   **Future Multi-Party Platform:** The vision includes connecting multiple lawyers and clients, creating a comprehensive two-way platform for legal services.

### Billing System (`Bills`)
*   **Transparent Billing:** Addresses the current vagueness in legal office billing by providing clear, itemized bills.
*   **Digital Invoices:** Clients receive bills with outstanding items, with options to download detailed invoices.
*   **Integrated Payments:** A "Pay Now" feature with Stripe implementation allows for immediate and convenient payment processing.

### User Interface (Designed with Lovable)
*   **Intuitive "Legal Mailbox" UI:** A central hub displaying pending legal tasks (Beyond Presence calls) and a history of completed assessments.
*   **"Play" Button:** Initiates the AI assessment process for a pending task, leading to a live report view.
*   **Live Report View:** A dedicated page for real-time display of streaming outputs from all three AI agents, providing a "live-typing" experience.
*   **Actionable Buttons:** Includes options to "Download Full Report," "Schedule Meeting with Lawyer" (if recommended), and "Save to Account" (simulating saving the report to the platform's history).
*   **Modern Design:** A frictionless, visually appealing interface with rounded corners, smooth animations, and a professional aesthetic, designed using Lovable.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technologies

## üöÄ Demo Flow (End-to-End)

1.  **Lawyer Logs In:** A lawyer accesses the Cicero platform (already in a logged-in state for the demo).
2.  **View Inbox:** The "Inbox" dashboard displays a list of pending legal tasks, each representing a completed Beyond Presence client call or a new request from a lawyer.
3.  **Initiate AI Meeting:** The lawyer clicks the "Start AI Meeting" button on a pending task. This launches a Beyond Presence video agent.
4.  **Call Completion & Transcript Fetch:** After the Beyond Presence call is "finished" (simulated by clicking "Call Finished" in the UI), the frontend triggers an API call to `/get_latest_call_transcript` on the FastAPI backend. The backend uses the `bey-client` to fetch the actual transcript from Beyond Presence.
5.  **Backend Intake & Session ID:** The backend stores the fetched transcript in memory and generates a unique `session_id`, returning it to the frontend along with a `redirect_url`.
6.  **Live Report View:** The UI automatically navigates to the `/report/:session_id` page, displaying the `FocusWindow`.
7.  **Parallel Streaming of AI Agents:** The frontend simultaneously initiates streaming requests to the backend for:
    *   `/stream_summary/:session_id` (Summary Agent)
    *   `/stream_legal_assessment/:session_id` (Legal Assessment Agent)
8.  **Sequential Streaming of Risk Assessment:** Once the Legal Assessment stream completes, its full text is captured by the UI and then sent as a `postBody` to `/stream_risk_assessment/:session_id` (Legal Summary & Next Steps Agent).
9.  **Real-time Display:** All three agent outputs are displayed live, character-by-character, in their respective sections on the UI, providing an engaging "live-typing" experience.
10. **Actionable Insights:** The lawyer can then:
    *   Download the full report.
    *   Schedule a meeting with a human lawyer (if the AI recommends it).
    *   Save the report to their account history.
11. **Task Completion:** The lawyer marks the task as complete, moving it to the "Recently Completed" section in the Inbox.
